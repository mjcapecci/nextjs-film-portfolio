            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Born and raised in and around Chicago, I have loved the art of
              story-telling from an early age. Being a film fanatic most of my
              life, I thought the best way to grow my knowledge of the art was
              to dive headfirst structure and flow. In 2014 I started online
              classes and Youtube tutorials in my free time to develop my skills
              as an editor. Utilizing Adobe's functionality, I eventually became
              fluent in Premiere, After Effects Photoshop, and Audition.

              I have worked for JoBlo Media Inc. since 2016 and currently
              produce three shows on their successful YoutTube channel, Joblo
              Horror Videos., WTF Happened To That Horror Movie, The Black
              Sheep, and The Best Horror Movie You Never saw. As a full-time
              editor, writer, and showrunner, My job is to help others, set time
              tables with realistic and strategic goals. Editing is
              story-telling, and you must think about every angle to best
              communicate the idea and overcome any hurdle you may encounter. I
              believe you must put your drive and passion first and deliver
              quality and consistency at any cost. Life is too short not to give
              it your all.
